# DAT253-MarchingTetCubes

## Marching Squares and marching tetrahedron, with Dicom dataset loading in Unity3D.

Created for the DAT253 course at [Western Norway University of Applied Sciences (HVL)](https://www.hvl.no).

The marching algorithms are from [this repository](https://github.com/Scrawk/Marching-Cubes) by [Scrawk](https://github.com/Scrawk/), and can be found in the 3rdparty asset directory.

Uses the ["Fellow Oak Dicom" library](https://github.com/fo-dicom/fo-dicom) for loading and reading Dicom data sets.
